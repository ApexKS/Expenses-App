# Expenses-App
A barebones app for Android to make expense report.

Made using kivy. Converted to apk using Buildozer in WSL.

Only contains menu, credit & debit screens. Contains two textboxes in latter two screens.

Yet to make(as on 25/07):
1. Save Button
2. Adjusting button sizes for android.
3. Saving to a json file or excel file.
4. Creating charts out of the data files.
5. Creating a separate screen for the charts in app.
6. UI Design.
